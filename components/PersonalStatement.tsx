    <h2>Personal Statement</h2>
    <p>
      Daniel has two software development related degrees and is staying in practice through personal projects and
      providing additional value to his employer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daniel constantly looks at how new technologies and techniques can be used to improve the quality of his work,
      however he always weighs potential gains against required investment. At Triptease, he encouraged and helped
      people learning Rust, but cautioned about making the jump to it too early; the potential for resource optimisation
      did not outweigh the cost of people learning a new technology. At Apolitical however, Daniel evangalised
      kubernetes, docker, Node and Rust and coached colleagues in their use. At MOO, he evangelised Docker and CD
      Pipelines to increase developer confidence and code quality, as well as pushing for more testing and quality
      control.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daniel can pick up new languages, frameworks and techniques very quickly, and loves to do so. He constantly looks
      for new ways to improve on what he&apos;s already doing.
