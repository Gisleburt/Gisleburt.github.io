This provided the scale we needed to begin delivering our bigger initiatives. Daniel then split the team into two sub-squads, delegating some of the leadership to his two more senior engineers. The squads could then specialise on internationalisation and localisation tasks separately. Danielâ€™s biggest efforts have been put into helping his reports pursue career goals by tying their development areas into Pelotons career ladder and the businesses long term ambitions. Daniels has focused on cultivating an environment that allows his team members to succeed and grow.</p></section><!--</[daniel_mason_blog::page::cv::experience_detail::ExperienceDetail]>--></div><!--</[daniel_mason_blog::App]>-->
