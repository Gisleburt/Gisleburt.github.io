            <p>
                Aye Aye Api is a PHP framework for building RESTful APIs. It was designed around the idea that modern
                frameworks, while providing many useful features, do not actually help developers develop.
            </p>
            <p>
                Aye Aye is small, very easy to use, and handles all of the communication between the server and the
                client, allowing the client to choose what format data should be returned to them in, and how they
                would prefer to send data in the first place. Developers need only describe the data they expect
                through method definition and appropriate PHP DocBlocks, returning data in any way they see fit (sting,
                object, array, Generator, etc).

            <p>
                Masonry is a tool for managing tasks, and was designed to forfil two main roles.
                <ul>
                    <li>A single pass task runner, such as a build script</li>
                    <li>A long running event listener, running tasks as they appear in a queue</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                As with Aye Aye, Masonry was born out a feeling that modern frameworks (at least in PHP) for these kinds
                of tasks, were not as helpful to developers as they could be.
            </p>

            <p>
                Masonry provides a Composer plugin that allows easy registry of new modules, providing exceedingly easy
                extensibility.
